AFAD(Asian Face Age Dataset) only 15 ~ 75 https://github.com/John-niu-07/tarball

All-Age-Faces-Dataset 2 ~ 80 https://github.com/JingchunCheng/All-Age-Faces-Dataset

Original images folder split into adult and minor folders

Rename all images from: 
    serial number + adult or minor + age Ex. 00001A02 
to:
    adult or minor + serial number Ex. A1

Random split images half to train and test folders

Tensorflow gpu usage doesn't support windows anymore -> use cpu / colab
    colab train too slow -> use cpu

VGG16: 
    batch_size = 32, train and test dataset -> 13322 = 6660 + 6662, epoch = 10
    set steps_per_epoch = validation_steps = 208
    colab : 1.5hr one epoch, cpu 5min(unreal) one epoch
    steps_per_epoch = 100, validation_steps = 50

        val_acc didn't change val_loss slightly raise + training overfit
        -> maybe dataset is too small
        --> add dropout,l1 l2 regularization / without train only input output
    
Decide to focuse on ages near 18
-> 1. use AFAD dataset 15 ~ 23 ages to test accuracy over every well-known,
    -> well behavior pretrained models
-> 2. use AAFD dataset 13 ~ 23 ages to try training above pretrained models accuracy
-> 3. self build a model to precicely identify adult or not by comparing other models
-> 4. try to combine self model and a single pretrained model to see if it performs
    -> better than any others
-> 5. try to combine multiple models or self trained model together
